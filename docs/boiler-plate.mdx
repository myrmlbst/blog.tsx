# Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for all articles and blog posts to maintain uniformity between all the blog posts. It can be accessed via ```docs/boiler-plate.txt```.

The `title` and `description` automatically appear at the top of the blog. 
The `date` variable, which indicates the date of writing the article (not the date of publication), is displayed only on the link that leads to the post.
The `published` boolean keeps the article hidden from the public if it is set to `false`, otherwise the blog is accessible to be read from the user-side.

This boilerplate also supports ```code snippets``` and callouts of different types.
For example: <Callout type="warning">Hello, I am a callout.</Callout>
