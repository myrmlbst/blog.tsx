        Hey there, I'm Myriam! I'm a computer science student with a passion for all things tech-related.
        <br /><br />
        While studying during my undergrad, I watched my knowledge expand endlessly; the more I learned, the more I knew I needed a place to keep track of all the knowledge I've acquired over the years.
        And that is how this blog was born! I'm using this site to upload and keep track of all the things I've learned within the past few years, and share them with other students who might also be in need.
        <br/><br/>
        I've also left the link to the source code in my GitHub repository to all those interested in web development to see how this blog was made.
